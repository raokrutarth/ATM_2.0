# Repository Guidelines

## Feature Branches

Developers should create "feature" branches when working on the code. The standard naming convention for feature branches is "feature/feature_name_here". When a feature is complete, it will be merged into "develop" by use of a pull request.

## The "develop" Branch

No code should be directly committed to the "develop" branch. Code should only be merged into "develop" using pull requests from completed feature branches.

## The "master" Branch

No code should be directly committed to the "master" branch. Code should only be merged into "master" from the develop branch when a release point has been reached.
